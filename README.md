This is a project that I'm currently working on to replicate some of the functionality from Ticketmaster. 


# Tech stack
- Nextjs
- React
- MySQL
- TailwindCSS

# Get Started
You can view a live version of the site at tickets.jackhumes.com. All the data is randomly generated. You can get a local version setup yourself by following these steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/member87/eventtickets/
cd eventtickets
npm install

# Enter DATABASE_URL in .env

npm run dev

http://localhost:3000
```
